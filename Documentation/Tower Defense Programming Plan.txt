Tower Defense Programming Plan:

- Create the Scenes.
- Implement the Scene Manager. This class is responsible to go from one scene to the other as well as define what scenes can transition to others.
- Add the buttons and SceneControllers to call the sceneManager.
- Implement the Back Button in the settings screen
- Add the statistics to the GamePlay scene. They will be just labels that will be modified by dummy buttons
