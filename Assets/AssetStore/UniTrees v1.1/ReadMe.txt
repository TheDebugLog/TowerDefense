UniTrees

A collection of 11 unusual Unity trees.

These plants might grow in a fantasy forest, an alien jungle, or even a mysterious island here on Earth. A mix of real and unreal. Since these are created with the Unity Tree Tool, each tree is actually a template for an entire species. Copy one of the prefabs and adjust one slider (Tree Seed) to create a new variation of that tree.


Notes:

+ The Unity Tree tool likes things big. Most of these plants are created at about twice the scale of their intended size. This lets me include more detail where it's needed. If you use them with the Terrain tools, you might want to size them near the lower limit of 50%. 

+ Remember, if you use the Tree tool to change a tree - it changes every tree based on the same prefab. To make a new variation of a tree you'll want to duplicate the Unity tree PREFAB first, then change then makes changes to the new copy. 

+ The demo scene is included mostly as away for you to see all the premade variations at once, but you can press play and wander around FPS style, too. 


v 1.1 | November, 2013
----------------------

+ Added prefabs that include single Capsule Colliders for each preset tree - just right for painting trees onto Unity Terrain.

+ Replaced the wonky 'shared textures' with Unity's standard tree textures. The shared textures were confusing many people and made extra work for most people who just wanted to use the normal tree textures. If you liked this old setup please email me with you Asset Store reciept number and I'll send you the v1.0 package.

+ Fixed some missing texture links in the bark and foliage materials.


v 1.0 | March, 2013
-------------------

+ 11 Unity trees including multiple preset variations

+ 16 bark and foliage texture

+ premade, shareable materials for each species of tree. *These are not longer included in v1.1.* 

Thanks to Richard Hill for help me with the name for this package. Great support and ideas from all around my Google+ circles!
